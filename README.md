## 🧪 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Perkywarcheif/skin-disease.git
   cd skin-disease

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:

		python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`

3.  **Install the required packages**:
     
        pip install -r requirements.txt

4.  **Run the application**:

         For script execution:

		           python Skin_disease_detector.py

         For Jupyter Notebook:

		           jupyter notebook runner.ipynb

 **📊 Dataset**
       
   **The dataset used for training and evaluation is included in the repository as skin_disease.csv. It contains labeled images of various skin conditions.**
